# DiscordApexBot JavaScript version

This is a simple discord bot for viewing stats from the battle royal game Apex Legends. It is using the Apex Legends API of HugoDerave. You can find his repo [here](https://github.com/HugoDerave/ApexLegendsAPI)

The bot was oroginaly written in Python, but now that the project is getting a bit bigger we have decided to change to JavaScript. You can find the Python repo [here](https://github.com/BakxY/DiscordApexBot). This is the first project for us with JavaScript, so the sintax and code will not be the best, but we are happy for any feedback.

## Run it yourself

We will create an guide on how to run the bot yourself. If you have any questions you can contact me on discord(BREXIT#2164) or just create an issue in the repo.

## I found a issue or want to help

If you find issues with the bot, please create an issue. If you see an open issue with no assignee we are happy if you help us out. Just write a comment on the issue that you are working on it, so we don't do our work for nothing.
