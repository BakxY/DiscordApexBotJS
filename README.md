# DiscordApexBot JavaScript version

This is a simple discord bot for viewing stats from the battle royal game Apex Legends. It is using the Apex Legends API of HugoDerave. You can find his repo [here](https://github.com/HugoDerave/ApexLegendsAPI)

The bot was originally written in Python, but now that the project is getting a bit bigger we have decided to change to JavaScript(TypeScript). You can find the Python version of the bot [here](https://github.com/BakxY/DiscordApexBot). This is the first project for us with JavaScript(TypeScript), so the syntax and code will not be the best, but we are happy for any feedback. 

Currently the bot is being setup step by step. We are converting the old Python code to TypeScript or rewriting entire parts.

## Run it yourself

We will create an guide on how to run the bot yourself. If you have any questions you can contact me on discord(BREXIT#2164) or just create an issue in the repo.

## I found a issue

If you find a bug or have an idea, please create an issue. We will look into it as soon as possible.
